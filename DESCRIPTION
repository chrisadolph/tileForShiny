Description: A generic layout function, tile, and a set of 
       graphicals displays plotable within a tiled layout,
       including standard displays like scatterplots, lineplots, 
       and dotcharts, and more experimental formats like nightplots
       and riceplots.  Includes tools for summarizing
       uncertain inferences from models, showing extrapolation
       from the original data range, fitting simple models to data, 
       annotating plots, adding rugs to axes, and controlling the 
       layering of plot elements.
